Compare these two medication lists.

**Directionality:**
- List A ("now"): {{baseline_label}} - This is the baseline/current state
- List B ("then"): {{reference_label}} - This is the reference/previous state

**Instructions:**
1. Identify medications that are NEW (appear only in List A)
2. Identify medications that are STOPPED (appear only in List B)
3. Identify medications that are CHANGED (same drug, different dose/route/frequency)
4. State "NONE" if a category has no medications - DO NOT invent or guess

**Output Format:**
Provide your response in this exact structure:

### New Medications
[List medications from List A that are not in List B, or state "NONE"]

### Stopped Medications
[List medications from List B that are not in List A, or state "NONE"]

### Changed Medications
[List medications that appear in both but with different dose/route/frequency, or state "NONE"]

### Continued (No Change)
[List medications that are identical in both lists, or state "NONE"]
