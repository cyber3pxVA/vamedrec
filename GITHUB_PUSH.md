## üìù Create GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/new
   - Or: https://github.com ‚Üí Click "New" button

2. **Repository Settings:**
   ```
   Repository name: vamedrec
   Description: VA Medication Reconciliation System - Hybrid AI-powered medication reconciliation
   Visibility: Private (recommended for VA projects)
   
   ‚ùå DO NOT initialize with:
   - README (you already have one)
   - .gitignore (you already have one)
   - License (VA project)
   ```

3. **Click "Create repository"**

### Option 2: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)

```powershell
gh repo create vamedrec --private --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

---

## üîó Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions. Use these commands:

### Step 1: Add Remote
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\VHAWRJDRESCF\OneDrive - Department of Veterans Affairs\Documents\GitHub\med-reconciliation"

# Replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec.git
```

### Step 2: Verify Remote
```powershell
git remote -v
```
Expected output:
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec.git (push)
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```powershell
# Push and set upstream
git push -u origin master
```

Or if your default branch should be 'main':
```powershell
# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üîê Authentication

When you push, GitHub will ask for authentication:

### Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. **Create Token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Name: `VAMedRec Development`
   - Scopes: Check `repo` (all repo permissions)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Use Token:**
   ```
   Username: your-github-username
   Password: paste-your-token-here
   ```

### Option 2: SSH Key

```powershell
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@va.gov"

# Copy public key
Get-Content ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | Set-Clipboard

# Add to GitHub:
# - Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
# - Click "New SSH key"
# - Paste your key
# - Save

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec.git

# Push
git push -u origin master
```

## ‚úÖ Verification After Push

### Check GitHub Repository
1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec
2. Verify files are there
3. Check that `.env` is **NOT** visible ‚úÖ
4. Verify `.env.example` **IS** visible ‚úÖ

### Check GitHub Actions
1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec/actions
2. You should see the Docker build workflow
3. It will fail until you add Docker Hub secrets (that's normal)

---

## üê≥ Set Up Docker Hub Integration

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets

1. **Go to repository settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec/settings/secrets/actions
   ```

2. **Click "New repository secret"**

3. **Add two secrets:**

   **Secret 1:**
   - Name: `DOCKER_USERNAME`
   - Value: Your Docker Hub username

   **Secret 2:**
   - Name: `DOCKER_PASSWORD`
   - Value: Your Docker Hub access token

### Step 2: Create Docker Hub Access Token

1. Go to: https://hub.docker.com
2. Log in
3. Go to: Account Settings ‚Üí Security
4. Click "New Access Token"
5. Name: `GitHub Actions - VAMedRec`
6. Permissions: Read, Write, Delete
7. Generate and copy the token
8. Use this as `DOCKER_PASSWORD` in GitHub secrets

### Step 3: Trigger Build

After adding secrets:
```powershell
# Make a small change
echo "`n# Updated" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: trigger Docker build"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Build Docker image
- Push to Docker Hub
- Tag as `yourusername/vamedrec:latest`

---

## üìä Monitor the Build

1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec/actions
2. Click on the running workflow
3. Watch real-time logs
4. Wait for green checkmark ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Quick Command Reference

```powershell
# Check current status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Check remote
git remote -v

# Add remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master

# Future pushes (after first push)
git push

# Pull latest changes
git pull

# View differences
git diff
```

---

## üîÑ Daily Workflow (After Initial Push)

```powershell
# 1. Make changes to your code
# ... edit files ...

# 2. Check what changed
git status
git diff

# 3. Stage changes
git add .

# 4. Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve bug in reconciliation"
# or
git commit -m "docs: update documentation"

# 5. Push to GitHub (triggers Docker build)
git push

# 6. Check GitHub Actions for build status
```

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Commit Message Conventions

Use conventional commits for clarity:

```
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation changes
style: formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.
refactor: code restructuring
test: adding tests
chore: maintenance tasks
ci: CI/CD changes
```

Examples:
```powershell
git commit -m "feat: add drug interaction checking"
git commit -m "fix: resolve Azure OpenAI timeout issue"
git commit -m "docs: update Docker deployment guide"
git commit -m "ci: update GitHub Actions workflow"
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Push Rejected
```powershell
# Pull first, then push
git pull origin master
git push
```

### Wrong Remote URL
```powershell
# Update remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vamedrec.git
```

### Accidentally Committed .env
```powershell
# If not pushed yet
git reset HEAD~1
git restore .env

# If already pushed - ROTATE ALL SECRETS IMMEDIATELY
# Then remove from history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
git push --force
```

### Authentication Failed
- Use Personal Access Token instead of password
- Or set up SSH keys
- Check token hasn't expired
