# üè• VAMedRec - Medication Reconciliation Report

**Generated:** 2025-10-20 11:11:13  
**System:** VAMedRec v1.0 - VA Medication Reconciliation System


## üìã Clinical Narrative & Analysis

### Overview
This is a test reconciliation report generated in SKIP_LLM mode. AI-powered clinical analysis is disabled. Enable LLM integration for full narrative analysis.

### Key Medication Changes Identified

1. **SKIP_LLM mode is enabled - detailed medication change analysis unavailable**

2. **Set MEDREC_SKIP_LLM=False and configure valid API credentials to enable full AI analysis**

### Clinical Significance

Clinical significance analysis requires AI/LLM integration. The system has successfully extracted and normalized medications using NLP (medSpaCy), but reconciliation logic and narrative generation are stubbed in test mode.

### Recommendations for Clinical Team

1. Configure Azure OpenAI credentials in environment variables
2. Set MEDREC_SKIP_LLM=False to enable full LLM-powered reconciliation
3. Review extracted medications to verify NLP extraction accuracy
